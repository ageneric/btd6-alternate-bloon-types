# Alternate Bloon Types
### A Bloon Set for the BTD6 Bloon Factory Mod

by Kevin / ijkx

To add new 5 Bloon types that encourage you to adapt your strategies without
disrupting the standard BTD6 rounds and balance, with a focus on rounds 1-80.

Best experienced on any Hard mode variant (except ABR or CHIMPS) - make it
challenging! Because enabling this pack only slightly increases difficulty.
